## My Travel Dictionary App

  This app allows you to quickly translate English words into 13 other languages. The app is powered by the Yandex translator API because it's free.
This is indended to be a quick way to refer to common phrases when visiting other places. The app adresses how cumbersome it is to keep pulling out
Google Translate on a trip, and allows you to pre-translate a set of words and phrases to be referred to later. This is also useful if there isn't an internet connection.
The app in it's current state doesn't completely adress the problem, since it doesn't peramently store data between runs. 
Areas of future work could include persistent data storage, and adding a pronounciation feature.
